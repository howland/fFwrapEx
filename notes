Various notes for install (READ LAST POINT ***)
Needed to also include:
 fortran parser f2py
 an older version of numpy

******************************************************************************
VERY IMPORTANT: VERSION OF NUMPY INSTALLED MUST PREDATE 1.8.0!  Support for numpy scons was removed as indicated by this pull request on numpy's github:
  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/2914

fWrap is dependant on numpy.scons, a sub library used in numpy that was removed as of numpy version 1.8.  In order to be able to use fWrap, you must have numpy 1.7.$ installed. Below is a link to a linux distribution of 1.7.0:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.0/numpy-1.7.0.tar.gz/download

Instructions:
  (1) type "pip uninstall numpy"
  for some reason, if numpy is not manually removed, reinstalling with a lesser version will not overwright the binary.  Theirfore, before installing the outdated version you must remove the new.
     [if using anaconda: conda remove numpy]
  (2) install numpy 1.7.0 from source with:
     python setup.py install build
     (I did python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95 to make sure it used gfortran)
  (3) install fWrap from source using directions below
  
******************************************************************************

IMPORTANT:  Must install fwrap from NEW source.. not listed on blog.  Github repository has not been updated since 2010.
    https://github.com/kwmsmith/fwrap/blob/master/INSTALL.txt
  NEWER SOURCE (use this one): (updated in 2010)
    https://bitbucket.org/kwmsmith/fwrap-dev

(Note: if you installed Python with Anaconda, you might already have fwrap. Was this one built properly?)

Installation instructions:

1) get f2py from googlecode:
  $ hg clone https://f2py.googlecode.com/hg/ f2py
  in the f2py folder:
  $ ./setup.py build
  $ ./setup.py install
  (not sure if these steps are needed or not?)

2) get fwrap-dev
  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/kwmsmith/fwrap-dev

3) put a symbolic link from the f2py/fparser package in
fwrap-dev/fwrap/ directory.

  $ cd /path/to/fwrap-dev/fwrap
  $ ln -s /path/to/f2py/fparser 
  $ cd ../ 
  $ python setup.py install
  $ python runtests.py -vv --fcompiler=gnu95 --no-cleanup 
    (note: Rachel fails 7 tests)

4) add fwrapc to your path if you don't already have it


Wrapping complie flags:
  fwrapc source.f90 --build --name=one_arg --fcompiler=gnu95 --f90exec=/usr/bin/gfortran-4.8 -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_linux-gnu/4.8.2 -lgfortran

[for rachel: fwrapc source.f90 --build --name=one_arg --fcompiler=gnu95 --f90exec=/usr/bin/gfortran-4.6 -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_linux-gnu/4.6.3 -lgfortran]
