System requirements notes:

fWrap is dependant on numpy.scons, a sub library used in numpy that was removed as of numpy version 1.8.  In order to be able to use fWrap, you must have numpy 1.7.$ installed. I have attatched a copy of the numpy 1.7.0 package for convenience.

Instructions:
  (1) type "pip uninstall numpy"
  for some reason, if numpy is not manually removed, reinstalling with a lesser version will not overwright the binary.  Theirfore, before installing the outdated version you must remove the new.
  (2) install numpy 1.7.0 from source with:
     python setup.py install build
  (3) install fWrap from source
  
Now fWrap is good to go!
