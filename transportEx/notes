NOTES FOR TRANSPORT EQUATION WRAPPING EXAMPLE:

The compile and debug scripts all used the proprietary ifort compiler to comipler
to compile the fortran 90 code.  I changed "ifort" to "gfortran" to compile the code.
Because of this, I had to change the compiler flags. 

Here is the translation betewen them:
  ifort          gfortran    Flag meaningd
  -c
  -g
  -traceback
  -check all
  -fpe0 <xx>
