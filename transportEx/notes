NOTES FOR TRANSPORT EQUATION WRAPPING EXAMPLE:

The compile and debug scripts all used the proprietary ifort compiler to comipler
to compile the fortran 90 code.  I changed "ifort" to "gfortran" to compile the code.
Because of this, I had to change a number of syntax items listed below.  They included
the compiler flags (not yet complete), certain "==" to ".eqv." and two instances of 
GETARGS from the 3 parameter call to the 2 parameter call.

Current result after following README instructions and calling result in the following
error, but still create a output file (that appears to be correct?).

josh@josh-ThinkPad-W530:~/Desktop/fFwrapEx/transportEx/3D/test_inps$ ../AHOTN/LN.exe inp4 testoutput
At line 31 of file lin_nodal_module.f90 (unit = 9, file = 'w0_LL.dat')
Fortran runtime error: End of file

The output file has been version controlled and is called "testoutput".  It is saved in the test
directory.

See ifortFlags and gnuFlags files for flag meanings.

Here is the translation betewen them:
  ifort            gfortran/gnu   
  -c               not nessesary?
  -g               
  -traceback
  -check all
  -fpe0 <xx>
  -r8
  -03

Here is a helpful article for converting flags.  Not nearly complete though..
